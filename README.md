# 🚗 Car Rental Reservation & Fleet Management System (RFMS)

> A business case implementation for optimizing operations in a growing car rental company using an integrated digital reservation and fleet management system.

## ✨ Project Summary

This project addresses real-world operational challenges faced by a car rental company experiencing rapid growth. The current **manual booking processes** were leading to:

- Long customer wait times
- Double bookings and resource conflicts
- Lack of centralized fleet data

To solve these issues, we proposed and designed a scalable, cloud-based **Reservation and Fleet Management System (RFMS)** using **Rent Centric**, which provides end-to-end digital automation of bookings, fleet tracking, and customer interaction.
